My program processes `.ppm` or `.pgm` image files of types **P2**, **P3**, **P5**, or **P6**, whether they are text/binary or grayscale/color, using standard commands entered via the keyboard.

* When the **`LOAD`** command is entered, the path to the image file is read, and the file is first opened in text mode. If necessary, it is then reopened in binary mode to read its contents properly.

* For the **`SELECT`** command, the parameter following the command is checked—either `"ALL"` or coordinates `"x1, y1, x2, y2"`.

  * If `"ALL"` is given, the entire image matrix is selected.
  * Otherwise, only the section defined by the four indices is selected, assuming the coordinates are valid.

* The **`HISTOGRAM`** command reads two parameters:

  * `x` – the maximum number of stars (`*`) allowed, and
  * `y` – the number of desired histogram bins (must be a power of 2).
    Then, the histogram of the image is displayed using `*` symbols, with the actual number of stars printed before each bar.

* The **`EQUALIZE`** command builds a frequency vector for the matrix elements and applies a specific formula to adjust the image’s histogram as described in the assignment.

* The **`ROTATE`** command includes a parameter representing the rotation angle.

  * The angle must be a multiple of 90 and within the range \[-360, 360].
  * The program performs the rotation either on the selected area or the entire matrix, depending on the context.

* The **`CROP`** command cuts the selected area from the full matrix (image), and that selected area becomes the new entire image.

* The **`APPLY`** command is followed by one of four parameters:
  `"EDGE"`, `"BLUR"`, `"GAUSSIAN_BLUR"`, or `"SHARPEN"`.
  The selected filter is applied to the entire image using the corresponding formulas for each effect.

* The **`SAVE`** command reads the filename and path where the image is to be saved.

  * Optionally, it can be followed by the `"ascii"` parameter, which indicates that the image should be saved in text format.
  * If this parameter is not provided, the image is saved in binary format.

* The **`EXIT`** command marks the end of the command sequence.
  At this point, the program checks whether all dynamically allocated matrices have been properly deallocated.

If an invalid command is entered or the parameters are incorrect, the message **"Invalid command"** will be displayed.

Throughout the program, various helper functions are used to simplify code readability and improve efficiency.
